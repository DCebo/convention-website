            Collect-It Con began as a small gathering of local TCG enthusiasts in Melbourne. 
            What started as a weekend meetup has grown into one of Australia&apos;s premier 
            trading card and collectibles conventions.

            Over the years, we&apos;ve expanded to include sports cards, gaming accessories, 
            and a wide variety of collectibles, while maintaining our focus on community 
            and the joy of collecting.
